The GitHub link contains two files. The Excel spreadsheet (PK05.xlsx) contains all the raw chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen data, as well as the five bands of data for the corresponding sampling points. The data for different months is labeled with different colors in the spreadsheet, for a total of six data periods. The second file is Python code (DO_estimate), which contains the optimal model for chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen, namely the random forest model, and plots the spatial distribution map based on the model. In addition, due to the large amount of raw image data, we have stored the raw image data in Baidu Cloud Drive. The specific link is: (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LKuVopY7zG0uEeDU50ue6g?pwd=1234), which contains the raw image data of the breeding base for each month.
